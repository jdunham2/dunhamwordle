# User Accounts System - DEPLOYED! üöÄ

## What Just Happened:

We've implemented a **complete user accounts system** with in-app challenge delivery!

## ‚úÖ Features Deployed:

### 1. **User Authentication**
- Sign in with avatar selection (160+ emojis!)
- Create new accounts or login to existing ones
- Search/filter users by username
- Persistent sessions via localStorage

### 2. **In-App Challenge Delivery**
- Send challenges directly to other users
- No more external sharing or URLs needed!
- Instant delivery through the backend
- Challenges appear in recipient's inbox

### 3. **Challenge Inbox**
- View all received challenges
- Filter: All / Pending / Completed
- Unread notification badges
- One-click to start playing

### 4. **Real-Time Notifications**
- Red badge showing unread challenge count
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Updates when challenges are completed
- Push notification infrastructure ready (PWA)

## üéØ How It Works:

### For Users:
1. **First Visit**: See avatar selection screen
2. **Create Account**: Pick username and avatar
3. **Send Challenge**: 
   - Click Share2 icon (top left)
   - Enter a word
   - Select a user from the list
   - Challenge sent instantly!
4. **Receive Challenge**:
   - Inbox icon (top left) shows red badge with count
   - Click to see all challenges
   - Click challenge to play
5. **Complete Challenge**:
   - Sender gets notified
   - Shows in their "Sent Challenges" page
   - Can view replay

### Backend (Deno Deploy):
- **Database**: Deno KV (built-in, free)
- **Storage**: Users, challenges, inbox, completions
- **API**: 11 new endpoints for user management
- **Auto-Deploy**: Connected to GitHub, deploys on push

## üìä Database Structure:

```javascript
{
  users: {
    [userId]: {
      userId, username, avatar, createdAt, lastSeen
    }
  },
  userChallenges: {
    [userId]: [
      { challengeId, fromUserId, word, sentAt, read, completed, result }
    ]
  },
  challenges: {
    [challengeId]: { word, createdAt, completedCount }
  },
  completions: [
    { challengeId, completerName, result, completedAt }
  ],
  pushSubscriptions: {
    [userId]: { subscription }
  }
}
```

## üîß API Endpoints:

### User Management:
- `GET /api/users` - Get all users
- `POST /api/user/create` - Create new user
- `GET /api/user/check/:username` - Check if username is available
- `GET /api/user/:username` - Get user by username
- `POST /api/user/:userId/login` - Login user
- `GET /api/user/:userId/challenges` - Get user's received challenges

### Challenge Management:
- `POST /api/challenge/send` - Send challenge to user
- `POST /api/challenge/:id/read` - Mark challenge as read
- `POST /api/challenge/:id/complete` - Mark challenge as completed
- `POST /api/user/:userId/push-subscribe` - Save push subscription

## üöÄ Testing Instructions:

### 1. Wait for Deno Deploy:
- Go to https://dash.deno.com
- Check your project: `jdunham2-dunhamwordl-36`
- Wait for deployment to complete (~30 seconds)
- Check logs for any errors

### 2. Test on GitHub Pages:
```
https://jdunham2.github.io/dunhamwordle/
```

### 3. Test Flow:
1. **Create First User**:
   - Enter username (e.g., "Alice")
   - Pick an avatar
   - Should see start screen

2. **Create Second User** (different browser/incognito):
   - Enter username (e.g., "Bob")
   - Pick different avatar

3. **Send Challenge** (as Alice):
   - Click Share2 icon
   - Enter word (e.g., "HELLO")
   - Search for "Bob"
   - Click "Send Challenge"

4. **Receive Challenge** (as Bob):
   - Refresh page or wait 30 seconds
   - See red badge on Inbox icon
   - Click Inbox
   - See challenge from Alice
   - Click to play!

5. **Complete Challenge** (as Bob):
   - Solve the word
   - Alice should get notified (check her "Sent Challenges")

## üêõ Troubleshooting:

### If users aren't loading:
- Check Deno Deploy logs for errors
- Verify WebSocket URL in browser console
- Check CORS headers

### If challenges aren't sending:
- Open browser console
- Check for API errors
- Verify Deno Deploy server is running

### If notifications don't update:
- Refresh the page
- Check unread count is calculating correctly
- Verify backend API is returning challenges

## üìù Future Enhancements (Optional):

- [ ] Web Push Notifications (VAPID keys needed)
- [ ] User profiles with stats
- [ ] Daily challenge leaderboard per user
- [ ] Friend lists
- [ ] Challenge history/analytics
- [ ] User avatars (upload custom images)
- [ ] User settings (theme, notifications)

## üéâ What's Changed:

### Before:
- No user accounts
- Challenges shared via URLs
- External messaging needed
- No tracking of who sent/received challenges

### After:
- ‚úÖ Persistent user accounts with avatars
- ‚úÖ In-app challenge delivery
- ‚úÖ Real-time notifications
- ‚úÖ Complete tracking of all challenges
- ‚úÖ No external sharing needed!

This is a **massive improvement** to the user experience! üöÄ
