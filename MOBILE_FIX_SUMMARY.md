# Mobile & Cross-Browser Sync Fixes

## âœ… Fixed Issues:

### 1. **Mobile Scrolling Fixed** 
- **Problem**: Create account page (and other modals) were cut off on mobile, couldn't scroll
- **Solution**:
  - Added `overflow-y-auto` to outer container
  - Responsive padding: `p-2` on mobile, `p-4` on desktop
  - Reduced avatar grid: 6 columns on mobile (was 8)
  - Smaller avatars on mobile: `text-2xl` vs `text-3xl`
  - Responsive text sizes throughout
  - Footer buttons stack vertically on mobile
  - Content area uses `flex-1` for dynamic height

### 2. **Oct 1 Completion Not Persisting**
- **Problem**: Completion synced to backend (200 OK) but wasn't loaded on refresh
- **Root Cause**: `user.dailyCompletions` wasn't returned from `/login` endpoint
- **Solution**: 
  - Backend now ensures `dailyCompletions` field exists in user object
  - Returns empty object `{}` if null
  - Frontend loads from backend on refresh

## ðŸ“± Mobile Improvements:

- Avatar grid fits better: 6 cols on mobile
- Text scales appropriately: 2xl on mobile â†’ 4xl on desktop  
- Buttons stack vertically on small screens
- Outer container allows scrolling
- Better padding/spacing throughout

## ðŸ”„ Cross-Browser Sync:

- Daily completions synced to Deno KV database
- Loaded from backend on login/refresh
- localStorage used as backup
- Works across any browser/device

## ðŸš€ Deployment:

- Frontend: Deployed (build: `index-CVXZXGRT.js`)
- Backend: Deployed (commit: `cefac5a`)
- Test: Sign in on Browser A, complete Word of the Day, refresh on Browser B â†’ shows completed!
